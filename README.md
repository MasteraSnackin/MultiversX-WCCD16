Explanation
Initialization: The contract initializes with no specific setup needed.

Minting Endpoint (mintCitizen):

Users send 10 "WOOD" and 15 "FOOD" tokens to mint a "CITIZEN" NFT.
The tokens are burned by sending them to the zero address.
The minting event is scheduled for 1 hour later using a calculated block round.
Claiming Endpoint (claimCitizen):

Users can claim the "CITIZEN" NFT after the required waiting period.
Checks ensure that the claim is only allowed after the scheduled block round.
NFT Issuance: A placeholder function issue_nft is used to represent the NFT issuance process.

Round Calculation: A helper function calculates the number of blockchain rounds equivalent to one hour, assuming 6 seconds per round.

State Management:

pending_mint: Tracks the block round when a user can claim their NFT.
Documentation
Design Overview: The contract enables the minting of a "CITIZEN" NFT by burning specific amounts of "WOOD" and "FOOD" tokens. Tokens are burned, and NFTs are minted after a delay.

Deployment Guide: Compile the Rust code to Wasm using the Rust toolchain and deploy it on a blockchain that supports Wasm smart contracts, such as MultiversX.

Usage Instructions: Users interact with the mintCitizen and claimCitizen endpoints to mint and claim NFTs.

Verification: The contract's source code and ABI should be open-sourced for community verification.

This setup provides a robust framework for minting NFTs based on burning tokens, with a delay mechanism to ensure proper timing. Adjustments can be made for specific blockchain environments or additional features as needed.
